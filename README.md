# Project Title

Tracks non linear trajectories of particles in order to create an animation demonstrating relaxation  
time.

## Instructions

Creates an animation frame which can be controled within mathematica as well as exporting a gif into the current folder

* by defauld number of particles is set at 50 this can be adjusted within the code

## Caviots/Improvements

* If continuing this project, it would be helpful to track the actual relaxation time by defining  
  a convergence based on the repitition of x or y coordinates to within some defined accuracy.
